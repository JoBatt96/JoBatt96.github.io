## Math - Computer science - Physics

I offer private lessons to middle school student since 2016. When I started my bachelor degree in computer science in 2018 at University of Trento I started offering lessons also to high school students.

My lessons are mostly in presence, but during the COVID-19 pandemic I switched to online platforms, like zoom. Currently I offer the possibility of online lessons only if the subject permits it.

If you want to know more contact me.
